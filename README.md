How to call C functions from swift without much reusability

AsPackague
Create a Library for Swift thats calling C functions

```
# to compile
cd AsPackague/TestApp
make
make run # you should see something like "Value from C in Packague TestLibrary: 46"
```

Note: AsPackague/TestLibrary needs to be a git repo itself the Makefile takes care of this
